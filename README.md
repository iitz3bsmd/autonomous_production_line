## System Requirements 
â€¢	Functionality: The system should be able to autonomously assemble products or components according to predefined specifications.

â€¢	The system must be capable of performing the following tasks on products yet in no particular order of operations: Feeding, Assembly, Sorting, Handling and Storage.

â€¢	Integration: The system should seamlessly integrate the before mentioned stages.

â€¢	Reliability: The system should operate reliably over extended periods without frequent breakdowns or interruptions.

â€¢	Flexibility: The system should be adaptable to changes in production requirements or product configurations.

â€¢	The System must incorporate the following features: Camera for part recognition, PID control.


## System Design
### Mechanical Modules
â€¢	Feeding Module: this subsystem is responsible for feeding parts to the conveyer part by part.
â€¢	Conveyer Module: this subsystem is responsible for moving and stopping the part at different stages such as color detection and sorting and is controlled with a PID controller.
â€¢	Arm Module: this final subsystem is responsible for assembling and storing the assembled parts.
### System Control Architecture
The main controller for the system is a Raspberry Pi 2, which handles communication between other microcontrollers and keeps track of parts to be assembled.

## Matalab Work
We used MATLAB for:
1. Actuator Sizing
2. System Identification 
3. PID Control

### Actuator Sizing
We Modeled the full System on MATLAB Simulink to achieve proper sizing for the motors

### System Identification
To achieve PID control we must know the system parameters. so, using the system identification toolbox in MATLAB we got the closest estimation for system parameters

### PID Control
The last step was to model the PID control and tune the parameters which was achieved to errors below 1% !

## PCB Design
One of our goals was project reliability, and for that reason we designed and manufacutured a PCB housing 2 arduinos and connects to the entire system.
